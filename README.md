# HereThereBeMinecraft

This modpack is in Alpha. Not all mod inclusion decisions are finalized, nor have all compatibility and balance changes been implemented.

A heavy-weight (~100) modpack with various tech, magic and content. The intention is to get a smooth power curve established and provide challenging content at all stages of the game without introducing artificial barriers.

This modpack is intended for distribution from CurseForge. https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/here-there-be

Please make sure that your profile, or your client, is set to 4GB RAM for this to run comfortably. It could maybe go lower, but I won't test or support lower than that, it's 2019.

This pack contains a 3rd party mod (actually, 3, but all components of the same package): Galacticraft. Thanks much to the authors and please visit their siteÂ https://micdoodle8.com/mods/galacticraft
