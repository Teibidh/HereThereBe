# HereThereBeMinecraft

This modpack is in Alpha. Not all mod inclusion decisions are finalized, nor have all compatibility and balance changes been implemented.

A heavy-weight (~100) modpack with various tech, magic and content. The intention is to get a smooth power curve established and provide challenging content at all stages of the game without introducing artificial barriers.

This modpack is intended for distribution from CurseForge. https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/here-there-be

Please make sure that your profile, or your client, is set to 4GB RAM for this to run comfortably. It could maybe go lower, but I won't test or support lower than that, it's 2019.

This pack contains a 3rd party mod (actually, 3, but all components of the same package): Galacticraft. If you choose to download the modpack from here please note that the modlist file does not include these due to some distribution concerns on the part of the Galacticraft team. These mod files are also not available here, you'll have to get them fromÂ https://micdoodle8.com/mods/galacticraft which is where you can also support the authors of these mods.
