# HereThereBeMinecraft
A heavy-weight (~100) modpack with various tech, magic and content. The intention is to get a smooth power curve established and provide challenging content at all stages of the game without introducing artificial barriers.

 

Currently testing Draconic Evolution and Avaritia, even though they're regarded as absurdly overpowered. If they make it through Alpha they will likely continue on.

 

Please make sure that your profile, or your client, is set to 4GB RAM for this to run comfortably. It could maybe go lower, but I won't test or support lower than that, it's 2019.

 

This pack contains a 3rd party mod (actually, 3, but all components of the same package): Galacticraft. Thanks much to the authors and please visit their site https://micdoodle8.com/mods/galacticraft
